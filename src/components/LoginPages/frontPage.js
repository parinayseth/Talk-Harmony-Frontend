            If you ever looked at AI image generators like Dall-E and Midjourney and thought, hey, I wish could upload my photos to them and have them edited with just text descriptions, then you are in luck. A new AI image editor tool called InstructPix2Pix allows you to do just that.
            Available on the AI tool website Hugging Face, which also hosted the viral bot Dall-E Mini, InstructPix2Pix asks for an input image and prompt instructions and outputs a touched-up image with the changes you requested.
